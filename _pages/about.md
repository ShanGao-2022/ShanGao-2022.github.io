I'm a first year Ph.D. student from the College of Safety Science and Engineering, Civil Aviation University of China. My interests include [human factors](), [ergonomics](), and [safety engineering]() in the field of aviation. I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Lei Wang](https://www.cauc.edu.cn/yjsy/info/1139/1441.htm/) of the Lab of Human Factors in Aviation, Civil Aviation University of China. 

I reveived my master's degree in Flight Technology and Safety in 2021 at the College of Safety Science and Engineering, Civil Aviation University of China, and bechalor's degree in Safety Engineering in 2018 at the College of Safety Science and Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology. Before my Ph.D. career, I also worked as a research assistant at the Center of Psychological Sciences, Zhejiang University from 2021 to 2022.

You can find my CV here: [Shan Gao's CV](../assets/CV.pdf).

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
